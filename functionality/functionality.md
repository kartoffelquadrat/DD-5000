   * Master source models folder location
   * Master template location
   * Possibly: Expected amount inputs

## Output configuration

 * Textual
 * Logfile
 * Display with UI options for sort / filter criteria
 * Export


## Sample UI

A sample UI, to help identify required functionality

## Pseudo code

Main algo (assuming a porper folder strcture, as generated by the bash script):

![java-algo](java-algo.jpg#figure)

Takeaways:

 * Creates per student a plagiarism map
   * Key: ecore IDs shared with at least another student
   * Value: List of students with that id collision
 * Prints these details for any student with non empty lists.

```
parse configuration
  set input folder
  set template location
treat template
  import, parse template
  extract blacklist ecore ids from template
initialize empty global ecore id map
treat input folder
  for every direct subfolder S of input folder:
    find all ram files
    for ever ram file R in ram files
       import, parse ram file
       extract all ecore ids that not blacklisted
       add name of S to key (ecore id) in global ecore id map (ignore if S already present)
    done
  done
organize findings
  for every ecore identifier in global map
    if more than one student
      for every student
        add details to plagiarism map of student  
      done
    fi
  done
  for all students
    if collision counter not empty
      print student details
      print collision details: collision map size, collision details: ID-> colliding students.
```
