# Duplicate Detector 5000

Ecore ID duplicate detection made easy.

## About

The *Duplicate Detector [5000](https://youtu.be/UKygju476tM?t=18)* (*DD-5000*) is a software that analyzes models created with [TouchCORE](http://touchcore.cs.mcgill.ca/) and searches recurrent ecore identifiers. Ecore identifiers are commonly generated randomly. Therefore, potential results allow for an easy detection of plagiarisms. The *DD-5000* operates on a single input directory and presents findings in an intuitive format.

## Usage

### Data Preparation

In a first step the studnet submissions must be brought into a certain format:

 * Get the mycourses submissions. (A folder with all zipped submissions) + an index html file.
 * Run the [preparation script](dataprep.sh) (creates one folder per student, named as student name+id)  
```bash
./dataprep.sh source-folder target-folder
```  
This:
   * Creates a master folder, named like ```target-folder```
   * Creates one subfolder per student name
   * Removes all hidden files / OS meta files


### Compile / Run Analyzer

Now you can run the DD-5000 java program. It searches fore ecore identifier collisions in student submissions and prints them to screen.

 * Make sure JDK-11 or higher is installed.
 * Place the sample files for the mandatory unit tests at the right location: 
   * Unzip [DD5000-test-files](DD5000-test-files.zip).
   * Place ```TemplateTestDir``` and ```SubmissionTestDir``` in ```/tmp/```
 * Compile the sources:
   * ```mvn clean package```
 * Run the DD-5000. You can use either of:
   * Run using maven:  
```mvn exec:java "-Dexec.args=/path/to/templates/folder /path/to/submissions/folder"```
   * Run using JAR:  
```java -jar DuplicateDetector5000.jar /path/to/templates/folder /path/to/submissions/folder```



 > **Note:** ```/path/to/submissions/folder``` must follow the structure as generated by the *[Data Preparation](#data-preparation)* script.
