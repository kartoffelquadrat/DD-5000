Ecore ID duplicate detection made easy.

## About

The *Duplicate Detector [5000](https://youtu.be/UKygju476tM?t=18)* (*DD-5000*) is a software that analyzes models created with [TouchCORE](http://touchcore.cs.mcgill.ca/) and searches recurrent ecore identifiers. Ecore identifiers are commonly generated randomly. Therefore, potential results allow for an easy detection of plagiarisms. The *DD-5000* operates on a single input directory and presents findings in an intuitive format.
